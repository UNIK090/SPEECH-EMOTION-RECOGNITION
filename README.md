# SPEECH-EMOTION-RECOGNITION
**Using Deep Learning and RAVDESS Dataset**  

This project involves building a system to identify emotions from speech using deep learning techniques. The **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)** dataset is used, which contains recordings of speech and song expressed in various emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and calmness.  

The key steps in the project include:  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Extracting features from audio files, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which capture important audio characteristics.  
2. **Model Design**: Building a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, LSTM, or a hybrid model) to learn patterns and classify emotions.  
3. **Training**: Training the model using the processed features and validating it to avoid overfitting.  
4. **Evaluation**: Testing the model's accuracy on unseen data and analyzing its performance metrics.  

The final system can recognize emotions from speech inputs, making it useful for applications in healthcare, customer service, and human-computer interaction.
